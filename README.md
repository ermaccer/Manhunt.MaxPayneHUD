# Bullet Time

Max Payne HUD adds working Bullet Time, to use it, you need to press the Inventory (PC - TAB/MMB by default)
button to activate or deactivate it. This does not cause conflicts whenever you want to replace your item,
holding TAB won't activate it.

You start each level with 15 points (limit), you earn points in 2 ways:
 - Executing enemies - 4 points 
 - Killing enemies - 2 points
 
Activating bullet time will start decreasing current points represented
in a hour glass.
